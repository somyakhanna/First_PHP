    <h2>Cooking tips</h2>
    <ul type="circle">
    <li>Remember, y'all, it's all about the prep!</li>
    <li>The smaller the item, the higher the baking temperature. </li>
    <li>Store spices in a cool, dark place, not above your stove. Humidity, light and heat will cause herbs and spices to lose their flavor.</li>
    <li>After working with garlic, rub your hands vigorously on your stainless steel sink for 30 seconds before washing them. It will remove the odor.</li>
    <li>Wear an apron while cooking,and gloves while baking.</li>
    <li>Be careful with hot food.</li>
